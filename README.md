# tictactoe
This application is part of The Odin Project. 
This is an application in using JS of the classic game Tic Tac Toe. 
The goal of the project is to make a working TicTacToe game with modulized code by avoiding poluting the namespace of the main code.
Another challenging part of the Project is to implement an AI to play against the player.
